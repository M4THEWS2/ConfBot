# **ConfBot**: easy peasy bot creation
This is the most new released version (in development branch) of ConfBot! This new version is coming out with many improviments and better permormance. Wich will make *your* experience with ConfBot the best possible!

## What I have been made until now:
I've been working on the functions that were present on the 'old' ConfBot. **But It won't take so long!** I'm sure in few days I'm gonna be ready to start creating other functions.

## Can I test this version now?
For sure! You download ConfBot normally as you made with the 'old' version and use it as you want.

## Features already in:
- Now, there is a *log* file, wich you can see all the commands that were ran, see wich user ran them, see what time it was and wich day.

  - ### *Example of **log**:*
  ```log
  [SÃ³Matheus#5879] (694949148956426348) ran the function [say] (for the 1 time) with the command [ping] at Central Dos Soldados ðŸª– (869308360804155433). ---> 8/13/2022, 8:50:23 PM
  ```

- ## Don't worry! There's much ***more*** to come.
