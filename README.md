# **ConfBot**: easy peasy bot creation
This is the most new released version (in development branch) of ConfBot! This new version is coming out with many improvements and better performance. Which will make *your* experience with ConfBot the best possible!

## What I have done so far:
I've been working on the functions that were present on the 'old' ConfBot. **But it won't take so long!** I'm sure in few days I'm gonna be ready to start creating other functions.

## Can I test this version now?
For sure! You can download ConfBot as you normally did with the 'old' version and use it however you like.

## New features already in:
- Now, there is a *log* file where you can see all the commands that were run, which user ran them, see what time it was and what day.

  - ### *Example of **log**:*
  ```log
  [SÃ³Matheus#5879] (694949148956426348) ran the function [button] with the command [bb] (1 time(s)) at Central Dos Soldados ðŸª– (869308360804155433). ---> 8/15/2022, 12:39:21 PM
  ```

- Now, you can customize every message that ConfBot will send, such as: error messages when executing commands and functions, command not found messages and much more! To customize them go to ***`config/lang.json`*** and change the texts as you wish.

## Don't worry! There's much ***more*** to come.
